I am doing an experiment this year to see if I can do 100 different dining experiences without double takes. Why not, life is crazy? 

##The Motivation
I really enjoy eating out with friends, and do it quite a lot. However I always end up back at the same few spots, enjoying the same food that I know I like. Since it costs a premium to live in London, I just felt like I should start taking advantage of its offering. So I decided I should make 2016 the year of trying new places!

##The Rules
The rules are pretty simple. A restaurant counts on the list if I sit down and eat in at the restaurant. Take-away meals do not count, unless that restaurant has already been on the list. This is to prevent me from circumventing the system by ordering take-away for the sake of it, but keeps go-to take-away places off the list! The only expection is if I am forced to go somewhere, i.e. my boss invites me.

How far do I think I can make it? No idea, I have a feeling that staying away from my favourite places might be the biggest challenge.

## Thoughts

##### 07 March 2016

It is getting increasingly difficult to keep to this. It was a mistake to go to all my favourite/fimilar places in the begining, now all that is left is the unfimilar. Going forward I also want to try and maintain a list of places I want to try because I am too picky to risk choosing a restaurant on the fly! I am also considering stopping the experiment at 50 restaurants, I will see closer to the day.

##### 17 April 2016
Looks increasingly likely that I will stop the experiment at 50 restaurants. My rule for not counting takeaway seems to almost defeat the point; I have gotten take away from the same place multiple times. Not to forget how tidious it is getting to remember where you can and cannot go, and trying to explain to your friends why you cannot go to a particular restaurant.


## Conclusion
To come...
